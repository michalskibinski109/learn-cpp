# Strings and string literals

## Char

A `char` is a single byte of data, which can represent a single character. In C++, a `char` can be used to represent a character or a small integer. The ASCII table is a common way to map characters to integers. For example, the ASCII value of 'A' is 65, and 'a' is 97.

Sure, here's how you can add tabs to your MDX file. The first tab will contain your current code, and the second tab will contain an example of an array of characters:


<Tabs
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Single Character', value: 'tab1'},
    {label: 'Array of Characters', value: 'tab2'},
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="tab1">

```cpp
char character = 'A';

std::cout << character << std::endl;  // A
std::cout << (int)character << std::endl;  // 65
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tab2">

```cpp
char *characters = "Hello, World!";
// char characters[] = "Hello, World!";

std::cout << characters << std::endl;  // Hello, World!
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::tip what is difference between `char *str` and `char str[]`?
`char *str` is a pointer to a character, while `char str[]` is an array of characters. The main difference is that `char *str` is a pointer that can be reassigned to point to different memory locations, while `char str[]` is an array that has a fixed size and cannot be reassigned.

## String

A `string` is a sequence of characters. In C++, strings are represented by the `std::string` class, which is part of the C++ Standard Library. You can create a string by enclosing characters in double quotes.

```cpp
#include <string>

std::string name = "John Doe";

std::cout << name << std::endl;  // John Doe
```

How does computer know where the string ends?
The computer knows where the string ends by using a null-terminator character (`\0`). The null-terminator is a special character that marks the end of a string. When the computer encounters a null-terminator, it knows that the string has ended.

```cpp
char str[2] = {'H', 'I'};
std::cout << str << std::endl;  // HI�p���
char str2[3] = {'H', 'I', '\0'}; // \0 is the null-terminator
std::cout << str2 << std::endl;  // HI
```
