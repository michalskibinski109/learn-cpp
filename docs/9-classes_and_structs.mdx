};

:::tip Why don't we need `this` keyword here?
it's not necessary to use this to access members within the object's methods, unless there's a naming conflict.
:::



### Constructor and Destructor

```cpp

class Player {
public:
        int x, y;
        int speed;

        // Constructor
        Player(int x, int y) {
                this->x = x;
                this->y = y;
        }

        // Destructor
        ~Player() {
                std::cout << "Player at position (" << x << ", " << y << ") is being destroyed." << std::endl;
        }
};
```

### Initializer list



```cpp
Player::Player(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
```
:::tip Why initializer is better?
Initializing member variables in the constructor body involves two steps: default construction and assignment. Using an initializer list directly assigns the provided value, which is more efficient, especially for classes with many member variables or complex objects.
:::

```cpp
class Player {
public:
        int x, y;
        string name;

        Player(int x, int y, string name) : x(x), y(y), name(name) {
        }// OK
        Player(int x, int y, string name) : x(x),  name(name),y(y) {
        }// Not Ok, the order of the variables in the initializer list must match the order of the member variables in the class definition.
};
```


#### When to not use initializer list?
If you need to perform some complex logic to compute the initial value of a member variable, you may need to use the constructor body to do so. However, in most cases, using an initializer list is preferred for efficiency and clarity.



### Instantiation

#### On the stack

```cpp
{
        Player player(5, 5);
} // Destructor called here
```

#### On the heap

```cpp
Player* player = new Player(5, 5);
```

:::tip Should I use stack or heap?
Use the stack for objects with a short lifetime, and the heap for objects with a long lifetime. **The stack is faster and more efficient**, but has limited size, while the heap is slower and less efficient, but has more space.
:::


### Inheritance

```cpp
class Player {
        public:
        int x, y;
        int speed;

        Player(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}

        void Move(int xa, int ya) {
                x += xa * speed; 
                y += ya * speed;
        }
};

class Enemy : public Player {
        public:
        Enemy(int x, int y) : Player(x, y) {}

        void Attack(Player &player) {
                player.x = 0;
                player.y = 0;
        }
};
```

### Virtual methods

```cpp
class Entity {
        public:
        virtual void Print() const {
                std::cout << "Entity" << std::endl;
        }
};

class Player : public Entity {
        public:
        void Print() const override {
                std::cout << "Player" << std::endl;
        }
};
```
In this case, the `override` keyword is optional, but it is good practice to use it to indicate that the method is intended to override a virtual method in the base class. If the method does not override a virtual method in the base class, the compiler will generate an error.

:::tip Why do we need virtual methods?
Virtual methods allow derived classes to provide their own implementation of a method defined in the base class. This is useful for polymorphism, where objects of different derived classes can be treated as objects of the base class, allowing for more flexible and extensible code.
:::

### Dunder methods?

In cpp they are called operator overloading.

```cpp
class Entity {
        public:
        // __str__
        std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& stream) {
                stream << "Entity";
                return stream;
        }
};
```

Please note that not all Python dunder methods have direct equivalents in C++, and vice versa. The table above lists the most common ones.


### `static` in context of classes

`static` keyword in context of classes is used to define a member that is shared by all objects of the class.  It is just like

```python
class Player:
    speed = 2
```



## Why do we need ctructs at all.

Becouse of backward compatibility with C language. In C language there are no classes, so structs are used to define data structures. In C++ structs are used to define data structures as well, but they can also have member functions and access specifiers.
