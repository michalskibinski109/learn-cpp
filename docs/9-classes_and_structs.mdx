:::tip Why don't we need `this` keyword here?
it's not necessary to use this to access members within the object's methods, unless there's a naming conflict.

## Why do we need ctructs at all.

Becouse of backward compatibility with C language. In C language there are no classes, so structs are used to define data structures. In C++ structs are used to define data structures as well, but they can also have member functions and access specifiers.
