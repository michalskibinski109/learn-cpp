        {label: 'Class', value: 'class'},
        {label: 'Struct', value: 'struct'},
    ]}>

:::tip Why don't we need `this` keyword here?
it's not necessary to use this to access members within the object's methods, unless there's a naming conflict.

### Constructor and Destructor

```cpp

class Player {
public:
        int x, y;
        int speed;

        // Constructor
        Player(int x, int y) {
                this->x = x;
                this->y = y;
        }

        // Destructor
        ~Player() {
                std::cout << "Player at position (" << x << ", " << y << ") is being destroyed." << std::endl;
        }
};
```

### Initializer
```cpp
Player::Player(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
```
:::tip Why initializer is better?
When you initialize member variables in the constructor body, the member variables are first created using their default constructor and then assigned a value. This involves two operations - construction and assignment.
On the other hand, when you use an initializer list, the member variables are directly initialized with the provided value, which involves only one operation. This can be more efficient, especially for classes with a large number of member variables or for member variables that are complex objects themselves.
:::


#### When to not use initializer list?
If you need to perform some complex logic to compute the initial value of a member variable, you may need to use the constructor body to do so. However, in most cases, using an initializer list is preferred for efficiency and clarity.

### `static` in context of classes

`static` keyword in context of classes is used to define a member that is shared by all objects of the class.  It is just like

```python
class Player:
    speed = 2
```



## Why do we need ctructs at all.

Becouse of backward compatibility with C language. In C language there are no classes, so structs are used to define data structures. In C++ structs are used to define data structures as well, but they can also have member functions and access specifiers.
