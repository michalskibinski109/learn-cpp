```cpp
class Player {
public:
    int x, y;
    int speed;
    
    void Move(int xa, int ya) {
        x += xa * speed; 
        y += ya * speed;
    }
};
```

:::tip Why don't we need `this` keyword here?
it's not necessary to use this to access members within the object's methods, unless there's a naming conflict.
