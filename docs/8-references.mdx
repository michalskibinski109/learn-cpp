# References in C++

### What is a reference?
A reference in C++ is an **alias**, or an alternative name, for an existing variable. Once a reference is initialized to a variable, either the variable name or the reference name can be used to refer to the variable.

#### Example
```cpp
int x = 5; // Declare an integer variable
int &ref = x; // Declare a reference to the variable
LOG(ref); // Outputs: 5
LOG(&ref); // Outputs: memory address of x (e.g., 0000006CC94FFAF0)
```

:::warning references are immutable
Once a reference is initialized to a variable, it cannot be changed to refer to another variable. Pointers can.

### Using Pointers and References in Functions

<Tabs
  defaultValue="pointers"
  values={[
    {label: 'Using Pointers', value: 'pointers'},
    {label: 'Using References', value: 'references'},
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="pointers">

```cpp
void increment(int* value) {
    // value++; // This would increment the address of the pointer, not the value it points to.
    (*value)++; // This increments the value that the pointer points to.
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    increment(&x); // Pass the address of x to the function
    LOG(x); // Outputs: 6
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="references">

```cpp
void increment(int  &value) {
    value++;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    increment(x);
    LOG(x); // Outputs: 6
}
```

</TabItem>

:::warning arrays
arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions, so they can't be passed by reference in the same way as other types. However, you can pass an array by reference by wrapping it in a std::array or std::vector, or by using a reference to a pointer.

Workaround:
```cpp
void increment(int (&arr)[5]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        arr[i]++;
    }
}
```

### When to Use References Over Pointers

1. **Simplicity**: References are simpler to use than pointers.
2. **Safety**: References cannot be `NULL` and are guaranteed to refer to a valid object.
3. **Readability**: References make the code more readable and less cluttered.


### References in loops:


```cpp

for(auto &element : container){
    // do something with element
    element++; // this would increment the value of the element in the container
}

for (auto element : container){
    // do something with element
    element++; // this would increment the value of the copy of the element in the container
}

```
