# C++ Learning Project

## [Website](https://michalskibinski109.github.io/learn-cpp/)

Welcome to our C++ Learning Project! This project is a collection of notes, code snippets, and explanations of complex C++ concepts. Whether you're just starting out with C++ or looking to deepen your understanding of a specific topic, there's something here for you.

## Getting Started

These notes are organized by topic, so you can easily find the information you're looking for. To get the most out of these notes, we recommend watching the original course videos and then reviewing the corresponding notes to reinforce what you've learned.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you want to fix a typo, add a new section, or improve an existing one, your help is greatly appreciated. 

## Building the Project

This project uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. To build the project, run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn build
```

## Running Locally

To start a local development server, run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
